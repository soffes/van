# Smart Van

This is my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) configuration for my van. I’m planning to have several smart devices in the van so I can automatically notify myself when things need my attention (like tank levels, etc.)

I’m just getting started so it’s all pretty minimal right now.

## Features

* Sensor for where the van is that automatically updates the home’s location so weater and other location-based things stay in sync
